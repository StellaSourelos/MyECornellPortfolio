# MyECornellPortfolio
Includes all of my Jupyter Notebook assignments from the Cornell Tech/Break Through Tech 2025 Fellowship

Lab Files:
1. Lab8_DefineAndSolveML
   - Solved the problem of predicting whether a book review is positive or not, three different models were evaluated: a baseline logistic   regression model, a multinomial Naive Bayes model, and a tuned logistic regression model using grid search.
     
2. Lab7_implementCNN
   - Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It covers data preparation, CNN architecture design, training, and evaluating the model’s accuracy on both training and test sets.
     
3. Lab4_LogisticRegressionFromScratch
   -Implemented logistic regression from scratch using Python and NumPy, applying gradient descent with custom methods for computing probabilities, gradients, and the Hessian. The lab then benchmarks this custom model against scikit-learn’s implementation using an Airbnb dataset to predict whether a host is a superhost.


Data Files:
1. censusData
   - This data contains a mix of demographic, economic, housing, and sometimes geographic information about a population.
     
3. bookReviewsData
   - This data has only two labels that address book reviews: "Review" and "Positive Review"
